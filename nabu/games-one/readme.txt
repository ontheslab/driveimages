NABU Games (Image v1).

This is a small attempt to pull together (most) of the games (reported to work) under Cloud CP/M. All loaded onto a ready to run Cloud CP/M drive image.

It contains the following collection of NABU games and MSX rom files.

NABU Games (Ported / Converted) are in - User 0:
MSX Rom files (complete with MSX8) are in - User 1:
MSX8 Master files are in - User 2:

The Cloud CP/M drive image is called “cpm-g1v1.dsk”
You can rename and copy this file to your NIA “Store” folder as (for example) “B.DSK” and it will then be loaded in place of the “default”  “B” drive image.

Other information “txt” files can be found on the drive image.
